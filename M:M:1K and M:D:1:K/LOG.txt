REJECTION PR & CONFIDENCE INTERVALS COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS: 

The confidence intervals for the three test cases are very accurate. 
The q and Tq for each test case fit in their corresponding confidence 
intervals. All three confidence intervals for Tq are almost the same; 
however, the confidence intervals for q for part A and B are fairly the same 
while the q interval for part C is a bit bigger. We can conclude that this is 
probably due to the higher lambda of 65. We can also conclude that the service
time Ts probably does not effect the confidence intervals of Tq or q, because
there is barely a difference in either interval in part A and B. 

In addition, the expected/calculated rejection probability for all the test 
cases are (almost) the same as the simulated results.

CONFIDENCE INTERVALS COMPARISON AND ANALYSIS: 

The rejection probability for both cases is 0 because the waiting 
queue is always empty so no event/customer will be rejected. This can
be explained because w and Tw are both 0. 

The q and Tq simulated for both test case D and E fit in their 
respective confidence intervals. Here we see that the confidence 
intervals of q for both cases are the exact same despite the lambda 
difference, we can conclude that this is due to the fact that the waiting
queues are empty for for cases and that the same service time is constant. 

Parts B and C respectively have the same settings as test cases D and E.
These confidence intervals are surely smaller than the confidence intervals 
of q and Tq obtained in parts B and C. Since the only difference is the constant 
service time, we can conclude that the this is the reason behind the smaller
confidence interval range. 

Finally, unlike the rejection probability of .015 and .024 in test cases
B and C respectively; both D and E have a rejection probability of 0.0.
This is due to the constant service time. This was expected because w and 
Tw are 0. This means that no one ever has to wait in the queue, meaning 
there is always space for another event/customer, ultimately meaning no
one will be rejected, giving it a probability of 0.

Note: The setting for part (a) in this problem is the same as the setting used in problem #1 above. 
The settings for parts (b) and (c) in this problem are comparable to the settings in parts (b) and (c) for the M/M/1 system you simulated in Assignment #3. 

You may want to compare the results in both cases to make sure they make sense. Do the results make sense?
