PART A:
Results when Lambda = 60 and Ts = 0.015 and simulation time = 100
Simulator Results
q	=	9.30281690140845
w	=	8.390677397719651
Tq	=	0.1550469483568075
Tw	=	0.1398446232953275
> 

Expected results: 
rho = (60)*(0.015) = 0.9
q = (0.9)/(1-0.9) = 9 requests 
w = (0.9^2)/(1-0.9) = 8.2 requests 
Tq = 9/60 = 0.15 sec 
Tw = 8.1/60 = 0.14 sec 

PART B:
Results when Lambda = 50 and Ts = 0.015 and simulation time = 100
Simulator Results
q	=	3.152941176470588
w	=	2.211385199240987
Tq	=	0.07105882352941176
Tw	=	0.05622770398481974
> 

Expected results: 
rho = (50)*(0.015) = 0.75
q = (0.75)/(0.25) = 3 requests 
w = (0.75^2)/(0.25) = 2.25 requests 
Tq = 3/60 = 0.06 sec 
Tw = 2.25/50 = 0.045 sec 

PART C:
Results when Lambda = 65 and Ts = 0.015 and simulation time = 100
Simulator Results
q	=	36.617627997407645
w	=	35.63447828904731
Tq	=	0.5633481230370407

Expected results: 
rho = (65)*(0.015) = 0.98
q = (0.98)/(.02) = 48 requests 
w = (0.98^2)/(0.02) = 47.9 requests 
Tq = 48/65 = 0.74 sec 
Tw = 47.9/65 = 0.73 sec 

PART D: 
Results when Lambda = 65 and Ts = 0.020 and simulation time = 100
Simulator Results
q	=	2329.9966174661745
w	=	2328.9966174661745
Tq	=	35.84610180717191
Tw	=	35.8307171917873

Expected results: 
rho = (65)*(0.020) = 1.3
q = (1.3)/(1-1.3) = -4.3 requests 
w = (1.3^2)/(1-1.3) = -5.6 requests 
Tq = -4.3/65 = -0.066 sec 
Tw = -5.61/65 = -0.086 sec 

**Since rho was above 1 the system was rendered unstable and 
thus gives us negative expected results**
