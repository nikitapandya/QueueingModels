The .java files are for question 2 - the M/M/1 simulation: 
The folder Class files contains all the .class files for the corresponding .java files.
The simulation.java file contains the main function from where you can run the program. 
Upon running the program, the user will be asked for three inputs: first the lambda, then
the Ts and lastly the runTime. 

The Customer.java file handles execution of all events - birth, death and monitor. 
The Calendar.java file contains a "calendar" or "schedule" of events which is a 
linked list of "future" events.

***Run the function from the Simulation.java file through user input***
The LOG.txt file contains the log of the simulator generated answers and the calculated expected results. 

The hw3-written.pdf file contains the answers to the written questions 1, 3 and 4.
